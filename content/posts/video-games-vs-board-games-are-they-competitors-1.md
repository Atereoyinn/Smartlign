Video games are played virtually, on a computer, or on any other gaming device. On the other hand, board games are played on a tabletop or other hard surfaces.

Games, generally, have always been a part of human civilization. Although video games reached mainstream in the 19th century, board games date back centuries ago, with the oldest board game in the world being the royal game of Ur, which was created about 4,600 years ago. 

Some popular video games include Minecraft, God of war, Call of Duty, among others. Popular board games include Monopoly, chess, snakes, and ladder. 

While some gamers enjoy the near-real experience offered by video games, others enjoy the tactical experience that board games offer. Overall, games are fun, and both board games and video games offer many benefits.

## Benefits of Video Games

### Enjoy Your Favorite Games with Other Game-enthusiasts Like You From Anywhere in the World

This is arguably one of the most important benefits of video games- the fact that multiple players can connect online and enjoy a gaming session together. Even more, gaming services like Xbox, PSN, etc., allow real-time interaction when playing a video game.

Life can get so busy most times, and people can be occupied with so many commitments. Fortunately, you don't have to travel far when you want to unplug from the hustle and bustle of life and enjoy a video game with someone else.

You can simply connect online and enjoy a game together. Now that is one leverage video games have over other game types.



### Ready to Play Game

When you feel like playing a game, since you already have the game download and installed, all you need to do is turn on your computer or gaming device. Your game will be ready to play in a few seconds or minutes.

There’s no longer setup time, just log in and play.

### Visual Representation of All Your Actions

This is another great thing about video games. Whether engaging in a car race or finishing off a bad guy in an adventure game, all these play out before your eyes.

You get to see the graphic representation of your actions against your opponent. This tends to make gaming more immersive and engaging.

### Near Reality Gaming Environment

Video games are designed to mimic real-life scenarios or events—for example, PES or FIFA mirror real-life soccer settings.

Even more, the players are given names and characteristics of real-life players. Likewise, the games also mimic fans, commentators, and referees' reactions.

All of these make the soccer games exciting and give gamers the feeling of being real soccer players on the field.

### Enjoy a Solo Game

On days when your family or friends aren’t just available to play one or more gaming sessions with you, you can still enjoy a solo game. Most video games are designed to allow one player to play against the computer or multiple players to play against themselves.

### Drawbacks of Video Games

### Disconnection from the Real World

Some online video gamers are designed to allow gamers to chat and connect with other gamers. As such as an online video gamer, you could have a few virtual friends.

However, this cannot be compared to creating meaningful connections in the real world and having real friends.

### Tendency of Addiction

Most online video games have incredible graphics and eye-popping details that make gamers get lost in the game world. Gamers are often captivated by the game's narrative and want to see how each new level unfolds. Overall, when left uncontrolled, gaming can become very addictive. This addition may further affect other areas of life like academics, work, and even personal relationships.

### Adverse Health Conditions

Most jobs these days require using a computer. This means spending several hours of your day in front of a screen. 

So, spending more hours of your day during gameplay can further increase your risk of eye issues and other related sicknesses.

## Advantages of Board Games

### Physical Interaction with the Game

When playing board games, you get to interact with most, if not all, of the game's components physically. This creates a connection with the game compared to when you can only control the game through a gamepad, controller or tapping the screen when playing video games.

### Fosters Social Interaction and Strengthens Relationships

Board games provide an atmosphere to socialize and build meaningful relationships. There are many fun board games that can be played in social gatherings like picnics, thanksgiving, etc.

Specifically, you get to play with people that are physically present. Hence, it’s easy to establish genuine connections and build stronger relationships when you’re all physically in one place, playing the game together.

### Sharpens your Imagination and Mental Capacity

Games generally develop cognitive abilities and problem-solving. However, board games have been known to require sharp mental focus and critical thinking to solve the challenges.

Games like chess, monopoly, and scrabble, among others, require strategic movements to win. Furthermore, some games require memorizing the rules or strategy of the game.

These can enhance your thinking process and memory retention and develop your problem-solving skills. It can also sharpen your memory and improve memory retention.

### No Need to Invest in Powerful Gaming Equipment

This is arguably the most important benefit of board games. You don’t need to invest in heavy gaming consoles or computers. 

To enjoy smooth gaming sessions, you may need to invest in a high-end computer with the right specs to handle video games' heavy graphics. However, most board games come with all the components you’ll need to play a game.

### Downsides of Board Games

### Longer Setup Time

Some board games consist of many components that are challenging to set up. Some games might take 4 to 6 hours or longer to set up.

This can be quite discouraging and kill your enthusiasm to play. You might also be exhausted from the setup before you begin playing the game.

### Some Board Games can be Quite Bulky

Due to the many components of most board games, storing them can be quite a challenge. They tend to take up much storage space in your home and require a large surface to play on.

This can be quite challenging for people living in smaller apartments with limited free space.

### Prone to Disagreement and Conflict 

In every game, there’s bound to be a winner and a loser. In addition, while some people play games for fun, some see it as a competition.

When you play board games with someone who can't handle losing, there's a possibility of conflict and disagreement. It might even result in them attacking you when they detect that they're losing or mocking you when they realize they're winning.

In either case, the situation might escalate into a physical confrontation, which could be very dangerous.

### Complex

Some board games come with rule books or manuals that are several pages long. Therefore, understanding the rules of the game may take several minutes to hours, especially if you’re playing the game for the first time.

Memorizing these rules as you play is another big challenge. You may need to refer to the rule book occasionally to verify the rules, at least until you get used to the rules of the game.

Finally, solving the challenge and completing the game may take hours and sometimes a whole day, depending on the kind of board game. All of this can make playing the board game quite stressful and complex.
